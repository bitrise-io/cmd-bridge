## Changes

* replaced the previous `/tailf` lib solution with a new one: `github.com/ActiveState/tail`
    * this fixes occasional hangs
* lots of code & testing revision


## Install or upgrade

To install this version, run the following commands (in a bash shell):

```
curl -L https://github.com/bitrise-io/cmd-bridge/releases/download/0.9.3/cmd-bridge-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) > /usr/local/bin/cmd-bridge
```

Then:

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cmd-bridge
```

That's all, you're ready to call `cmd-bridge`!
